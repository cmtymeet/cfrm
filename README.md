# cfrm

Ephemeral community rendezvous and numerical participation rules, with deterministic abuse simulations.

The [Rust core](docs/rust-core.md) provides a member-authenticated multi-device meeting board and a durable introduction-allocation ledger. Every board device requires a member-owned root signature in addition to external eligibility. Full snapshots retain the signed rows for independent verification. The optional SQLite ledger shares one allowance across devices and process restarts. RFC9474 blind permits gate first introductions through atomic anonymous redemption. The [browser bindings](browser/README.md) perform local roster verification and permit preparation, recovery and stamp verification in Rust/Wasm. Private answer/close accounting remains unsupported pending a member-bound proof backend.

The earlier certified onion rendezvous library and numerical experiments remain available separately. cfrm composes with externally operated eligibility verification and [cmsg](https://github.com/corbet-labs/cmsg) for private information transport. Full private reciprocal accounting and numerical disapproval remain implementation work. It is not a complete deployed community service.

The experimental [private account ledger](docs/account-ledger.md) adds durable opaque-state updates, lifetime genesis uniqueness and authenticated recovery across devices. The [account-state foundation](experiments/private-accounting/account-state/README.md) has passed a real browser Answer flow through cmsg signatures, proof verification and Rust SQLite acceptance/recovery. The host must supply the complete pinned verifier. Full browser proofs currently take about 27 seconds and sampled browser memory exceeds 1 GiB; protected release, complete private accounting and mobile readiness remain unfinished.

The core/browser CI runs on GHA, with Crow as the fallback. At `3bc89d0`, 63 actual Chromium checks passed for the roster and blind permits, alongside 21 Rust and 55 historical JavaScript tests and portable Wasm checking. These results do not establish the missing private reciprocal-budget proof.

Run the historical simulations on Node 24 with no dependencies:

```sh
npm test
npm run experiment -- --seed 42
npm run sweep
```

| Read | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [Rules](docs/rules.md) | Precise experimental choices and abuse bounds |
| [Boundaries](docs/boundaries.md) | Live presence, stable IDs and the unsolved private accounting seam |
| [Experiments](experiments/README.md) | Reproducible terminal commands and behavior toggles |
| [Results](studies/first-experiment.md) | Measured collusion, limits and fairness failure |
| [Recovery comparison](studies/window-comparison.md) | 36 runs comparing bounded history with permanent debt |
| [Rendezvous library](studies/rendezvous.md) | Certified chat-key registration, onion discovery and ephemeral sessions |

The first 100-participant experiment limits flooding and reconnect resets, but its strict lifetime imbalance rule eventually stalls cooperative members. Bounded-window variants preserve later cooperative progress while allowing more hostile outreach; seeded comparisons measure both effects. These are experimental policy choices. The synthetic model knows relationships so that experiments can inspect them; an operator must not deploy that model as a member database.
