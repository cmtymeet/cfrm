# Reusable private accounting

This package implements the existing account-state-v2 relation. It contains the
real Barretenberg 5 / Noir prover and verifier, canonical account witnesses,
pinned artifact loading, and a signed transport-neutral client. It does not
change credit, lease, settlement, admission, or waiting-period semantics.

`createAccountProver` and `createAccountVerifier` take:

```js
const options = {
  manifestBytes,              // Uint8Array from the released manifest
  manifestSha256,             // independently pinned by the embedding application
  readArtifact,               // async (fixedName, maximumBytes) => Uint8Array
  limits: { memoryPages: 32768, maxProofBytes: 20000 },
};
const runtime = await createAccountProver(options);
const checkpoint = await checkpointFromVerified(community, verifiedEntries, runtime.hashes);
const candidate = await AccountWitness.genesis({
  hashes: runtime.hashes, community, policy, checkpoint, ownerIndex, ownerSecret, now,
});
const record = await runtime.prove(candidate);
```

The application verifies enrollment signatures before supplying `verifiedEntries`.
There is no synthetic roster or accepted-time list. `record` contains only the
statement, public proof and proof scope. `candidate.input` and `candidate.next`
contain private material and stay at the holder endpoint. A runtime permits one
proof or verification at a time; callers must also serialize witness hashing.
Run the runtime in an application-owned Worker if cancellation or UI isolation
is required, and terminate that Worker on cancellation. `destroy` releases the
backend after the current operation. It intentionally does not pretend an
abandoned Promise interrupts cryptographic work.

`AccountClient` receives `transport(envelope)`, `sign(bytes)` and the pinned
operator public key. `prepareApply` converts a public proof record to the exact
device-signed Rust request. **Persist that request together with the old and
successor private state before calling `apply`.** Only install the successor
after the verified acceptance is durable. Retry the exact signed request after a
lost reply. `prepareStatus` and `status` recover the latest acceptance or an exact
request with a fresh signed challenge. They do not recover lost private openings.
Transport receives no prover candidate. Grants and device authorizations retain
their existing camelCase wire formats.

The Rust `AccountService` exposes only authenticated `apply` and `status` on its
member JSON boundary. It owns the trusted clock and refreshes durable policy
before requests; the existing ledger rechecks time, policy, authority and state
at commit. Public policy retrieval and the local administrative checkpoint and
tuning methods are separate from member requests. An embedding must authorize
administrative calls and authenticate distribution of policy/artifact pins.
HTTP/onion transport, request-body streaming limits and response error mapping
belong to the embedding. No HTTP route or deployed service is installed here.

`ProcessAccountVerifier` invokes the concrete `node-verifier.mjs` with an
operator-owned absolute configuration file:

```json
{"directory":"/absolute/release/public","manifestSha256":"<independent release manifest SHA-256>","limits":{"maxProofBytes":20000,"memoryPages":32768}}
```

Configure the same circuit/VK digests in its Rust `scope`. Member inputs cannot
choose executable paths, configuration, artifacts, a clock or a roster. Worker
count, input/output sizes, deadline, Node heap and Wasm linear-memory maximum are
bounded. Excess work fails with `Capacity`; it is not queued indefinitely. The
Rust parent kills and reaps timed-out workers. These are component limits, not a
claim about exact process RSS or mobile memory. The shipped worker spawns no
children. Deploy only the trusted shipped script; arbitrary replacement workers
are outside the trust boundary.

Cryptographic verification alone does not accept a state. The Rust ledger is
the authoritative boundary for current enrollment roots, policy, server time,
root/device authority, permanent genesis, exact retries and state continuity.
This separation is why the generic cryptographic runtime has no member roster
or synthetic time allow-list.

Validation is split explicitly: `test/*.test.mjs` exercises artifact bounds,
live statement encoding and real Ed25519 client signatures; Rust
`tests/accounting_service.rs` covers service authority and process limits with a
storage-only verifier. The real browser proof suite calls the shared production
`proveAccountCandidate` core. After that suite, run:

```sh
node runtime/accounting/real-proof-check.mjs /absolute/config.json /absolute/browser-evidence.json
```

This independently runs the shipped cryptographic runtime over every reported
account proof and rejects corrupted proofs and changed proof scopes. Both
verifiers use the same backend; this does not establish implementation diversity.
