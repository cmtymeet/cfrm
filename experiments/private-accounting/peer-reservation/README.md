# Peer reservation proof foundation

**Version 2 source candidate; validation pending.** Crow 9/51 compiled the older
v1 relation at `0ae9b897490bd48810b89fcc561e9e04128a80bc`. No v2 browser proof or operator
acceptance interoperability result is claimed for this circuit. The measured
account-state runs use a different relation. Production private accounting and
protected release remain disabled.

This separate Noir relation proves membership of one Prepared (`1`) or Active
(`2`) obligation in an already accepted account state. Settled (`3`), Canceled
(`4`) and Expired (`5`) never
qualifies. Both roles use this same circuit. Its public statement is for the
authenticated peer channel only; it must never accompany a named operator
request. Balance, total reserved credit, other slots, map positions/paths and
the owner's secret remain private.

## Wire and verification contract

```
{ version: 2,
  statement: {
    community, owner, peer, role, nonce, group, contactPolicyDigest,
    historyDigest, phase, openedAt, ownerAuthority, accountPolicyDigest, stateVersion,
    stateCommitment, challenge, presentationBinding
  },
  proofScope: { circuitDigest, verifyingKeyDigest },
  proof, accountAcceptance }
```

Every digest/identifier/challenge is a canonical array of 32 bytes. Proof is
lowercase hex. Role `0` is the original initiator's outgoing obligation; role
`1` is the original recipient's incoming obligation. `accountAcceptance` is
the original signed Rust `AccountAcceptance`, including its entire named
statement and account-circuit proof scope. That account scope differs from the
new peer circuit scope. The peer learns the certificate's metadata as well as
the selected tuple; no certificate or presentation goes into its named update.

The relation has **388 public field elements**, ordered exactly as `main.nr`
and `publicInputValues()`. Arbitrary bytes32 use two big-endian u128 limbs;
state, owner-authority and presentation field outputs require canonical BN254 encoding.

Peer-only `ownerAuthority` is the exact enrollment leaf committed when this
owner reserved the slot. The native verifier supplies the initial MLS device
key; its trusted Node adapter matches that key and permanent owner to the
independently retained original cmsg delegation and recomputes the leaf. A
sibling device cannot substitute its own enrollment for that reservation.
This field never enters the named account statement.

The public peer-only `openedAt` is tied to the selected slot's immutable common
lease. Both peers must independently expect that same value. The host rejects
`now - openedAt >= abandonAfter`; Prepared evidence never authorizes incoming
debit or payload. Account acceptance uses protocol2 with its common validity
horizon; its original acceptance time must lie within that signed window.

`createPeerVerifier()` receives locally pinned peer and account circuit/VK
digests, exact compiled circuit/VK bytes and the host's actual
`verifyAccountAcceptance(certificate)` adapter. This adapter must invoke
`cfrm::accounting::verify_account_acceptance` under a pinned operator key and return `true`
only on success. There is no default verifier. An arbitrary success callback
would bypass that required trust boundary; it is not a supported substitute.

For each verification the host supplies:

- `expected`: all statement fields except `presentationBinding`, obtained from
  the authenticated cmsg exchange and the selected accepted state/version;
- `now`, the current trusted time, the common `accountPolicy`, and the trusted
  `enrollmentRoot` for the acceptance's common checkpoint.

The verifier checks the signature, scope, accepted commitment/version,
community/owner, exact policy digest and current validity, expected tuple and
fresh challenge, then verifies the actual proof under the pinned peer VK. The
host must bound transport JSON before parsing and must never accept expected
values or verifier implementations supplied by the presenting peer.

The success result does **not** consume the challenge or authorize data. cmsg
must durably consume the exact challenge, check current closure/consent/nonce
and its own current Active slot, and enforce the gate on every protected path.
Prepared evidence cannot authorize release. Caller state must retain challenge
use across device restore; repeat proof verification is deliberately stateless.

## Relation and context limits

The circuit repeats only the existing account encodings (secret, event, state,
slot, leaf and internal-node transcripts). JavaScript uses the existing
`account-state` hashes and `AccountWitness` maps. Poseidon2 itself comes from
the same pinned upstream library; no permutation or sponge is implemented here.
Selected membership authenticates the complete indexed leaf, including both
links, against a 32-level path. Linked-map ordering and count induction come
from the **accepted account-state relation**. Arbitrary imported roots or an
operator certificate for an unproved state do not establish that invariant.

The new fixed-length presentation hash is:

```
Poseidon2_fixed_10(
  ASCII("cfrm.peer-reservation.v2"), 1,
  ownerSecretHi128, ownerSecretLo128, acceptedState, selectedSlotHash,
  challengeHi128, challengeLo128, historyHi128, historyLo128)
```

It binds the challenge and history to the same secret and selected slot.
**History is presentation context:** the current account-state obligation does
not contain `historyDigest`. The owner can prepare a new valid presentation
under a different context; the verifying host must independently require the
actual cmsg history. This proof does not authenticate the contents or evolution
of an opaque history hash, or prove original recipient consent by itself.

A new challenge does not make a historical account certificate current. Current
local cmsg gates and monotonic slot transitions remain necessary. Malicious
operator forks require an independently consistent ledger/log assumption or
additional witnessing; this membership proof cannot establish non-equivocation.

## Bounded integration entrypoints

Compile-only, from `experiments/private-accounting` on the existing Crow worker
after its normal locked dependency installation:

```sh
timeout 600 node peer-reservation/compile.mjs "$PEER_ARTIFACT_DIR"
```

The helper uses the existing pinned Noir WASM compiler and file-manager
resolver, writing compiled JSON and source hashes to the mandatory separate
output directory. Only pinned `p2hash` is a dependency; no SHA or signature
circuit is required. It does not fetch setup or prove. Subsequent circuit stats
and VK also need a **separate peer artifact namespace**. No existing build
selector is required for this command. The shared CI also supports
`CHECK_PHASE=compile CIRCUIT_PACKAGE=peer-reservation`.

`runPeerReservationContract()` in `browser.mjs` is callable once the host has:

1. Compiled/pinned this relation and initialized the existing BB API with pinned
   public setup sufficient for it.
2. Retained an actual accepted live `AccountWitness`, selected event, and the
   real signed operator acceptance for that exact version/state.
3. Provided independent cmsg context/current policy and a real Rust acceptance
   verifier adapter, with a peer-generated challenge.

It creates one real proof and bounded adversarial witness/host cases, checks
public-input equality and repeats the positive proof after negatives. The
result contains peer-only presentation data; real deployments must not log it.
`createPeerVerifier()` is portable to Node for independent public-proof
verification using separately loaded/pinned artifacts and the real adapter.

The current source wires driver IPC to obtain the real acceptance **while the
browser retains its private opening**, browser/Rust verification and the trusted
Node adapter below. These changes await the next full validation run. Existing account browser results do not
retain openings outside the page. Do not serialize witnesses to the driver or
replace this step with a synthetic acceptance.

### Live fixture bridge

Account-mode builds also compile this relation and pin its separate circuit/VK
under `public/peer-reservation/`. Its padded degree must fit the already pinned
account setup; no additional setup service is contacted by the browser.

The test-only loopback `/account-ledger` accepts public account proofs and real
cmsg device authorizations. It reconstructs admission/device objects from the
server-retained native enrollment and calls the actual Rust ledger. Each
chronological proof receives its genuine signed acceptance before the page
advances its private witness. The bridge accepts no opening or Merkle path.

Native cmsg supplies independent challenges, context and initial device keys.
Its trusted process adapter invokes `verify-request.mjs` with locally pinned
manifest/enrollment/config paths. The adapter reconstructs the enrollment root,
verifies the peer proof and calls the real Rust acceptance verifier. For the
native own-current path only, it additionally queries the trusted own ledger
for the exact accepted version/commitment. It never queries a counterpart's
current account. Browser IPC exposes no current-account lookup.

The live bridge's bounded checks query every newly accepted own state, reject
absent/altered identities and states, and reject a previous accepted state after
its successor, including settlement. This is a **read-only snapshot**, not a
lock through delivery or evidence of distributed first-payload serialization.
cmsg must separately enforce initial device ownership, durable payload
consumption, closure history and lease validity. Historical Active certificates
cannot grant a new pair/nonce/group/lease, but proof verification alone does
not establish that a certificate is the latest one.

Only synthetic fixture pair presentations appear in test evidence. Production
must keep these artifacts on the authenticated peer channel. No live bridge
or new device-binding validation result is claimed until the corresponding CI
run passes.

See [the reservation protocol](../../../docs/private-reservation-protocol.md)
for the two-sided release and durable recovery requirements. Circuit cost,
actual browser memory and proof latency for this relation are unmeasured.
